# TOTEM-SHIFT REDUX CASE

Remixed the excellent [Totem Redux](https://www.printables.com/model/840146-totem-redux) by VOID and drew inspiration from BeeKeeb's rendition as well.
This case is made to be printed on an FDM printer, though it may work just fine on resin as well, I have not tested it.

My changes are as follows:
- Larger cavity above the diodes to accomodate larger battery.
- Removed all holes from the top in order to make it look cleaner and allow for future design choices.
- Replaced these top screw holes with recessed magnet holes so they can be stuck in.
- Removed the countersink from the bottom so that the midplate is screwed into the bottom plate and acts as the magnet retention mechanism, along with the feet recess as it won't print well on FDM.
- Removed all side holes except for the ON/OFF switch and USB-C port since the TRRS port is removed and the reset switch is now hidden under the top cover.

These files can be found in the [BLE Redux](/case/BLE%20Redux) folder.

# ORIGINAL TOTEM CASE

Each half consists of a bottom and a top part (with an integrated switchplate) and is meant to be 3D printed in resin. 

I got good results from [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) (15€ + tax and shipping for a black or white version) and [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=2&reffercode=TOP) (50€ + tax and shipping for a clear case).

Where possible use the STEP files, but the STL files should be fine too.

If you're sure you only will use the wired version you can also use the case without a power switch (USB) or use the case without a TRRS cutout if you plan on using the wireless version (BLE).

> **Note**
> The manufacturer will probably warn you about too thin sections, but it worked fine for me since these sections are pretty small.
