TOTEM-SHIFT is a modified 38 keys column-staggered split keyboard originally by GEIGEIGEIST. This TOTEM-SHIFT version aims to allow for a larger battery and emphasize styling options through a swappable top plate held with magnets. Meant to be used with a SEEED XIAO BLE or RP2040.
It was created for the SEEED XIAO keyboard contest by GEIGEIGEIST.\
[Here](https://www.hackster.io/geist/totem-a-tiny-splitkeyboard-with-splay-cb2e43) you can read about the process of making it.

Note that most of the guides and links will remain unchanged, the major changes will be to the 3D printed case design, as it uses the [TOTOEM Redux by VOID](https://www.printables.com/model/840146-totem-redux) case files as base, which are better suited to FDM 3D printing.

The PCB will slightly modified, so this version will not be compatible with existing PCBs or cases for the original TOTEM.

### ORIGINAL CREATOR

The amazing [GEIGEIGEIST](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST) whose design are beautiful and inspiring.
VOID who created a FDM optimized case [TOTOEM Redux](https://www.printables.com/model/840146-totem-redux).

### INSPIRATION

The additional pinky key makes the TOTEM compatible with the layout boards like the [Balbuzard](https://github.com/brow/balbuzard) by [Tom Brow](https://github.com/brow) and the [Osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette) by [Sam Mohr](https://github.com/smores56) use, where you put the keybinding of the top left and right keys on an outer pinky key.
